# ETL-Project
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. In this project a small group from KU Bootcamp take on the challenges that come with ETL. Extracting data from CSV files found on online web-sources, transforming the raw datasets to smaller usable pandas dataframes, loading it into an SQL database, our group completed the challenge.
